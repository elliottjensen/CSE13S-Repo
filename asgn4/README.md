Description:
Given a set of vertices, this function finds the shortest hamiltonian path. It recieves input that creates a graph of vertices with edges of different weights and is able to calculate the most shortest path that travels through every vertex exactly once and ends on the vertex it began.

Directions:
Once in the directory with tsp.c graph.c path.c stack.c and potentially a graph input file type make. Then type ./tsp and then the options you want. Type -i or -o followed by your desired input or output file and type -v to print every hamiltonian path or -u to make the graph undirected.
